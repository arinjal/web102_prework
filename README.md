## Notes

While building and adding functionaility to this website the main problems I encountered were understanding how to use a template string, challenge 6 with displaying description changes, and the pre-work instructions site itself since it was down numerous times throughout my devlopment process. Recalling the resources and previous knowledge from WEB101 made the flexbox and basic css changes much easier than my previous experiences!
